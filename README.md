# RunGPT
Interface to directly query OpenAI's GPT3 API.

Note: you will need to assign a `apitoken` variable inside a `_utils.py` file before running this program. Assign `apitoken` as your personal secret OpenAI API key.

### Usage:

From commandline:
`$ python gpt3.py`

Then, directly type in your query to the input field that opens on the command line.

Exit python to quit the program.
